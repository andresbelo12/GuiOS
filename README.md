For directories usage use the following commands:

    dc "directory name" // To create the directory "directory name"
    dd "directory name" // To delete the directory "directory name"

    ao "application name" // To create a new instance of "application name"
    ac "application name" [pid] // To close an application or instance of the application
    al "application name" // To list the instances of "application name"

    log [gui][files][kernel]// To get the log of a module

    exit // To stop all the program
